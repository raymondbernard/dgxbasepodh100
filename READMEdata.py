## IP addressing  

# As mentioned, the E/W network is a pure layer 3 network with p2p (/31) IPv4 addresses between the GPU NICs and the switches. Each GPU-switch port is a separate subnet but from a single supernet. All switch ports 
# connected to GPU NICs are breakout x4.

## BGP underlay network

# The underlay network is set on the `default` VRF. Although the E/W and the N/S use EVPN in different flavors, this underlay will serve both networks. 

# We start with the basic BGP configuration on VRF `default` with the `ipv4` and `l2vpn-evpn` address-families, then the `redistribute connected` with the `lo_subnet` route-map attached.

# **Note:** All BGP neighbors we use in our deployments are numbered. We decided not to go with [BGP unnumbered](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP/#bgp-unnumbered) since it's harder to troubleshoot network issues when dealing with iPv6 link-local underlay addresses.

## BGP overlay network

# The overlay network also runs on the `default` VRF. This network serves the NVE tunnels and both E/W and N/S networks. We intend to completely separate underlay and overlay networks and make the overlay more resilient to underlay link failures, so the overlay BGP peering is established between the switchesâ€™ loopback interfaces and the `ipv4` address-family is **disabled** on it (only `l2vpn-evpn` is used for this peering).

## E/W network BGP configuration

# The BasePOD is designed to be a multi-tenant environment, even though by default it is used as a single-tenant deployment. All the VXLAN, BGP, and EVPN configuration we made so far is to provide an infrastructure for that. The initial state of the configuration for the E/W network is a single-tenant running on VRF `tenant1`. 

# First, we must add the relevant GPU ports to the tenant VRF - `tenant1`.
nv set interface swp1s0-3,swp2s0-3,swp3s0-3,swp4s0-3 ip vrf tenant1

# Then, to create the `tenant1` control-plane and routing configuration, we create a BGP instance for this VRF with all related global parameters â€“ the `remote-as`, `router-id`, `ipv4`, and `l2vpn-evpn` address-families and statically set the route distinguisher (`rd`) for the VRF.

nv set vrf tenant1 router bgp enable on

nv set vrf tenant1 router bgp address-family ipv4-unicast enable on
nv set vrf tenant1 router bgp address-family l2vpn-evpn enable on

# **Note:** We set static `rd` so that the format for each future created VRF will be the same, and it will be easier to troubleshoot.

# To reduce route advertisements, we set the SN5600 switches to advertise a single summary route. We aggregate all GPU subnets with an `/24` subnet with an `aggregate-route` configuration. Then, we set a `summary-only` setting so that no specific routes will be advertised alongside the summary route. Again, this is less significant in small-scale deployments such as BasePOD but sufficient for scale-out.
nv set vrf tenant1 router bgp address-family ipv4-unicast aggregate-route 10.1.1.0/24 summary-only on

# As mentioned earlier, the E/W network is based on pure EVPN Type 5 routes. So, we use the `redistribute connected` statement with the previously created `dgx_subnets` route-map to insert only the GPU subnets into the `tenant1` VRF. To make all the redistributed GPU subnets EVPN Type 5 routes, we export them into EVPN using the `route-export to-evpn` configuration.

nv set vrf tenant1 evpn enable on

## N/S network layer 2 configuration

# As we already know, the N/S network must support layer 2 for the DGX management, BCM, k8s, and storage nodes. To enable layer 2, we create bridge domain `br_default` and set VLAN-to-VNI mapping for the EVPN-MH that will be set later for this network.  

nv set bridge domain br_default type vlan-aware
nv set bridge domain br_default vlan 121 vni 121
nv set bridge domain br_default vlan 122 vni 122

# Then we set all switchports to the required bridge mode and assign them to the needed VLANs. BCM nodes require two layer 2 ports each to the SN5600 switches, which must be set as `access` (untagged) ports. In our example, these are `VLAN121` and `VLAN122` (BCM requires two different subnets - `internal` and `external`).

nv set interface swp30s0 bridge domain br_default access 121
nv set interface swp30s1 bridge domain br_default access 122

# The rest of the nodes (DGX, k8s, and storage) are connected using active-active (LACP) bonds to both SN5600 switches. Those bonds are set with the general bonding configuration - `mtu`, `stp`, `lacp-bypass`, etc.

## N/S network EVPN-MH configuration

# To provide a standard active-active (and multi-tenant) N/S network without the need for MLAG, we use EVPN-MH. For that, we enable the `evpn multihoming` protocol globally, configure its `startup-delay`, and statically set the L2VNI `rds`.
nv set evpn multihoming enable on
nv set evpn multihoming startup-delay 10
nv set evpn vni 121 rd 10.10.10.1:121

# **Note:** We set static `rd` so that the format for each L2VNI created later will always be the same, and it will be easier to troubleshoot.

# Each bond has its own unique local multihoming segment identifier.
nv set interface bond1 evpn multihoming segment local-id 1
nv set interface bond2 evpn multihoming segment local-id 2

nv set interface bond9 evpn multihoming segment local-id 9

## N/S network VRR configuration

# To enable the N/S layer 2 network route outside the BasePOD (or between subnets within it), we set gateways to the VLANs (`VLAN121` and `VLAN122`). To provide an active-active and redundant gateway, we use VRR. 

nv set router vrr enable on

# Each VLAN has a virtual-IP and virtual-MAC addresses that will be used as the subnet gateways. We use typical VRR configuration with an SVI and virtual addresses.

nv set interface vlan121 vlan 121

## N/S network BGP configuration

# The N/S network BGP configuration is similar to the E/W (single-tenant). It runs on VRF `inband_storage`, and to enable its control-plane and routing, we create a separate BGP instance for this VRF with all related global parameters â€“ the `remote-as`, `router-id`, `ipv4`, and `l2vpn-evpn` address-families and statically set the route distinguisher (`rd`) for the VRF.

nv set vrf inband_storage router bgp address-family l2vpn-evpn enable on

# **Note:** We set static `rd` so that the format for each future create VRF will always be the same, and it will be easier to troubleshoot.

# We set a single summary route for this VRF to reduce route advertisements to the data center. We aggregate all inband subnets (in our case, a single subnet) with an `/16` prefix. Then, we set a `summary-only` configuration so no specific routes will be advertised alongside the summary route. 
nv set vrf inband_storage router bgp address-family ipv4-unicast aggregate-route 10.130.0.0/16 summary-only on

# Then, we use the `redistribute connected` statement with the previously created `inband_subnets` route-map to insert only the inband subnets into the `inband_storage` VRF (no loopback, uplinks, etc.).

## IPMI and edge networks configuration

Each of the SN5600 switches has four additional router ports. Two for IPMI switches uplinks, and two for the edge switches connection. In this demo, the IP addresses for those ports are also based on a p2p (`/31`).

# To IPMI:

# To edge:

# All these port subnets are within the `inband_storage` VRF as the N/S and the OOB-mgmt. networks must be accessible from the data center.

## E/W and N/S networks connectivity test

# To test E/W network all-to-all GPU connectivity, we placed a bash script named `ping_test.sh` on the `dgx01` node. This script sends 2 ICMP packets using the ping command to all DGX NICs with the source of each of the `dgx01` NICs.

# Run the script to verify E/W all-to-all connectivity.

ubuntu@dgx01:~$ ping 10.130.122.25 -I 10.1.1.0 -c 3
PING 10.130.122.25 (10.130.122.25) from 10.1.1.0 : 56(84) bytes of data.

A similar script (`./ping_test.sh`) is also placed on the `bcm01` node. By running it, verify all-to-all N/S network connectivity within the `inband_storage` VRF.
```bash
ubuntu@bcm01:~$ ./ping_test.sh

## Demo configuration recovery

If you made configuration changes to the demo environment and wish to revert all to the initial state, you can use the `basepod_config.yml` ansible-playbook located in the `cumulus_ansible_modules` folder on the `oob-mgmt-server`.
```bash
ubuntu@oob-mgmt-server:~$ cd cumulus_ansible_modules
ubuntu@oob-mgmt-server:~/cumulus_ansible_modules$ ansible-playbook playbooks/basepod_config.yml -i inventories/rail_optimized/hosts
```
